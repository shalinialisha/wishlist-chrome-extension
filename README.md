## My Process
I started by figuring out how my JavaScript elements need to interact with each other. Each time a user enters an item and link, a function creates a new div and adds that to index.html. It's a similar process for the deletion of the div (to remove items from the list). 

## What I learned
This was my first project that had a greater emphasis on JavaScript. I learned much more about how useful JavaScript can be, but I also missed the capabilities that React can bring to JavaScript. 

## Continued development
I'm going to make the extension able to save several different wishlists (so that the user can group future purchases together). I also want the ability to save "random" individual items. Instead of using JavaScript for this, I'm going to integrate React because it'll be much easier and more effective.
